#X text 163 41 VELOCITY SENSITIVE \, BUT A LITTLE FINICKY;
#X text 810 74 NOT VELOCITY SENSITIVE \, BUT MUCH MORE STABLE;
#X text 795 171 This using the modulus operator similar to the last
one \, but instead of counting incrementally \, it jst uses the velocity
output from the MIDI notes themselves. Since your velocity won't change
\, you just have to set it to an odd number (probably 127 as that is
the max so it's easiest) and this will work. Since the note-on velocity
is always odd and the note-off velocity is always even (it will be
0) \, the modulus remainder will be 1 for note-on and 0 for note-off.
Then all we have to do is place a select box for 1 at the end and voila
\, you got a bang for note-on but not note-off.;
#X text 172 109 This lil group over here with [int 1] and [% 2] stuff
is for only letting the note-on messages send a bang. This is good
for triggering an envelope when a note is pressed \, but not when it
is released. It essentially works by having the number box count incrementally
using the [int] box with the [+ 1] box. This is then put through the
modulus operator which ony lets odd numbers through (as 1) \, which
should be the note on messages as that will always come first. Then
using the [select] box it only lets 1's through (which should be the
note on messages as opposed to the not off's zeroes) and makes a bang
to be applied somewhere. The big problem with this one though is you
can mess up the incremental counting by pressing a note \, then pressing
another note \, then releasing the first note before you've realeased
the second. Since the counter goes up for note-on and note-off messages
\, these situations give it some trouble., f 59;
